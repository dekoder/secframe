### The first 30 days

## ESAE Phase 1 Outline

The purpose of the first 30 days and phase one of the Red Forest is to
1. Get people engaged and understand the necessity to separate credentials
2. To prep domain for the security changes that are about to be performed in domain.

These two goals are outlined in the three major topics below:

### Equip and engage

* Why is there need for [Separate Admin accounts for Administrative tasks](adminaccounts)
    * [Domain Admin accounts](adminaccounts/tier-0-admins/)
    * [Server admin accounts](adminaccounts/serveradmins/)
    * [Workstation admin accounts](adminaccounts/workstationadmins/)
* [What is the Privileged Access Workstations (PAWS) for Active Directory Administrators](paws/)
* [Why create unique local admin passwords](laps)

### Begin domain preparation

* Admin OU deployment - Wrap Active directory in a blanket of security for the devices, groups, and people that will manage the domain
* The first PAW Deployed
* [LAPS Installation](laps/install_laps)
* Create and Secure Tiered Administrators
