### Protecting Active Directory and Admin Users and Privileges by creating an administrative OU
 
*CENTRALIZE ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTS:*

The location of the administrative users and groups is often overlooked. If i were to perform an audit on any random domain, there's a major chance that I'd find administrative accounts scattered across multiple Organizational Units.
